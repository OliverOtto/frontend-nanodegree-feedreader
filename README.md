#Udacity Nanodegree Front End Developer Project 6

This Html Application is used to use the jasmine framework for testing the functionality.


---------

##Several Tests are conducted:**

* **RSS Feeds are defined**
* **RSS Feeds URLs are defined**
* **RSS Feeds names are defined**

* **The menu is hidden by default**
* **The menu is displayed when clicked**
* **The menu is hidden when clicked again**

* **Initial Entries are present - at least as single .entry element in the feed container**

* **New Feed Selection actually changes content**

---------

To test the functionality use index.html or the github url http://oliverotto.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader

The jasmine testsuite will be displayed on the bottom of the page and you can see the status of the tests - to manually retry the tests click the menu (menu should show) -> click the menu again (menu should hide again) -> click menu option (the feed should change accordingly)
