Udacity Nanodegree Front End Developer Project 6

This Html Application is used to use the jasmine framework for testing the functionality.

Several Tests are conducted:

RSS Feeds
	are defined
	URLs are defined
	names are defined

The menu
	is hidden by default
	is displayed when clicked
	is hidden when clicked again

Initial Entries
	are present - at least as single .entry element in the feed container

New Feed Selection
	actually changes content

To test the functionality use index.html or the github url http://oliverotto.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader

The jasmine testsuite will be displayed on the bottom of the page and you can see the status of the tests - to manually retry the tests click the menu (menu should show) -> click the menu again (menu should hide again) -> click menu option (the feed should change accordingly)
